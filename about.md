</div>

In 2011 I successfully graduated from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hs-augsburg.de/">University Applied Sciences</a> in Augsburg with a bachelor degree in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering and Web Development, and have been living in Augsburg ever since. I'm sporty, play the guitar since I am 15 and also have quite a few years of band experience.

I work as a freelance web developer with focus on Fullstack and JavaScript development. I support my clients from conception to delivery and always make sure to use contemporary technologies responsibly as well as not forgetting the needs of the end users.

Since April 2020, I am doing my Master's degree in <a href="https://www.hs-augsburg.de/en/Electrical-Engineering/Industrial-Security-and-Safety-MSc.html" target=_blank>Industrial Security and Safety</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hs-augsburg.de/">University of Applied Scienses</a> in Augsburg.

I particularly value quality assurance methods like test-driven development, code reviews, the use of version control or tools for static code analysis. Furthermore, I am a convinced user of open source software and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mwager/">engage myself</a> in this area as well, if my time allows it.

## Contact
