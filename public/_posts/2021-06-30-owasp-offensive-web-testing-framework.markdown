## Abstract

<div style="margin: 0 100px 0 40px">

<p style="font-style: italic">Penetration testers often need to work under time pressure. Companies may have limited budget but still need high quality results quickly. Therefore it is a major goal for penetration testers to work as efficient as possible and integrate the use of sophisticated and comprehensive tools to reach this goal.
<br>
<br>
In the context of the lecture Network Penetration Testing at the University of Applied Sciences, Augsburg, a collection of such tools will be presented in this report: the Offensive Web Testing Framework (OWTF) from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
