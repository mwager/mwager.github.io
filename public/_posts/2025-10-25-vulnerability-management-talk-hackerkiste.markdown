Last Friday, I had the pleasure of speaking at the [Hackerkiste Conference](https://hackerkiste.de/) in my hometown Augsburg ðŸ¥¨ â€” about one of my favorite topics:  
**How to make Vulnerability Management actually work** in modern DevSecOps environments.

In the talk, I shared:
- Why we need Vulnerability Management in the first place â€” *the chaos of SAST, SCA, Container, and IaC scanners*
- How tools like [OWASP DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) help unify results, automate triage, and connect findings to issue tracking  
- How we implemented it in real-world setups at [secureIO](https://www.secure-io.de/), automating remediation workflows across scanners and ticketing systems  
- Key lessons learned from building scalable, developer-friendly AppSec programs

My goal was to show that security can be **practical, automated, and developer-centric** â€” not just another compliance checkbox.
