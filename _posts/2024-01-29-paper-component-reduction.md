In January 2024 I finished my master thesis with the title "Evaluating the security of containers through reduction of potentially vulnerable components". For NDA reasons, I cannot publish it, so I created a paper from it. You can read it <a href="/assets/component_reduction_paper.pdf" target=_blank>here</a>.
