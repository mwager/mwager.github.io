I am doing my master's degree in <a href="https://www.hs-augsburg.de/en/Electrical-Engineering/Industrial-Security-and-Safety-MSc.html" target=_blank>Industrial Security and Safety</a> since april 2020 at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hs-augsburg.de/">University of Applied Scienses</a> in Augsburg. It was quite a crazy start due to corona. This post introduces my work on a major project, which I did together with two fellow students, which goal was to secure the state of an industrial automation facility by developing a configuration management solution.

## Abstract

<div style="margin: 0 100px 0 40px">

<p style="font-style: italic">Today‚Äôs enterprises in the producing industry are subjected to continuous
change and are required to adapt their production environment capabilities in
order to remain competitive. This causes continuously increasing complexity
and connectivity of modern production systems. To mitigate potential safety
and security incidents as well as optimization of the companies‚Äô business case,
a configuration management solution represents an effective instrument.
<br>
<br>
In context of the master course in Industrial Security at the University of
Applied Sciences, Augsburg, a configuration management project is conducted
on a real-world production facility by a group of three students.
<br>
<br>
Based on a fictional scenario concerning a manufacturer of smartphones
(Yeskia Inc.), an initial analysis of the enterprise environment regarding potential risks is performed and appropriate mitigations are derived. Based on
the mitigations a comprehensive concept phase is proposing various strategies
for realization. Following the V-Model approach, three individual software solutions are designed, implemented and validated. A training course with qualified
training material regarding the developed solutions concludes the project.
